# Problem Questions:

1. Write a program that inputs temperature from the user in Fahrenheit and converts
it into Celsius degree using formula 5/9(F – 32).


2. Write a program that inputs miles from the user and converts miles into kilometers.
One mile is equal to 1.609 kilometer.


3. Write a program that inputs 4 numbers and calculates the sum, average anProductof all the numbers.

4. Write a program that displays the following output:
Number Square Cube
1 	1 		1
2 	4 		8
3 	9 		27
4 	16  	64
5 	25  	125



5. Write a program to find out the area of triangle when three sides a, b and c of thetriangle are given. Use appropriate statements to input the values a, b and c from thekeyboard. Formula for the area of triangle is 
S=(a+b+c)/2
Area of Triangle=√s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)


6. Write a program that calculates the electricity bill. The rates of electricity per unitare as follows:
•	If the units consumed are <= 300, then the cost is Rs. 2 per unit.
•	If the units consumed are >300 and <=500, then the cost is Rs. 5 per unit.
•	If the units consumed exceed 500 then the cost per unit is Rs. 7
A line rent Rs. 150 is also added to the total bill and a surcharge of 5% extra if thebill exceeds Rs. 2000. Calculate the total bill with all the conditions given above.



7. Write a program that inputs three numbers and displays whether all the numbers are equal or not by using nested if condition.


8. Write a program that inputs a value and type of conversion. The program shouldthen display the output after conversion. The program should include followingconversions:
•	1 cm = .394 inches
•	1 liter = .264 gallons
•	1 kilometer = .622 miles
•	1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds
Make sure that the program accepts only valid choices for the type of conversion.



9. Write a program that allows the user to enter any character through the keyboardand determines whether it is a capital letter, small case letter, a digit number or aspecial symbol. 
Hint: >=‘A’ and <=‘Z’. >= ‘a’ and <= ‘z’ and for digit letter, >=‘0’ and <=‘9’. If a letter/character doesn’t satisfy above three conditions it means character is a symbol.


10. Write a program that gets the number and a letter as input. If the letter entered byuser is ‘f’, the program should treat the number entered as temperature in degreesFahrenheit and convert it convert it to the temperature in degree Celsius and print asuitable message. If the letter is ‘c’, the program should consider the number asCelsius temperature and convert it to Fahrenheit temperature and print a suitablemessage. The program should display error message and then exit if the user entersany other letter.


11. Write a C++ program to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross salary
according to following:
Basic Salary<=10000: HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
Basic Salary <= 20000: HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
Basic Salary > 20000: HRA = 30%, DA = 95%


12. Write a C++ program to input electricity unit charges and calculate total electricity bill
according to the given condition:
For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill
